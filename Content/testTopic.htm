        <h1>Ticket Types and FanSight Offers</h1>
        <p>Last week’s <MadCap:variable name="General.FanSight" /> release impacts a few offer configuration steps that you need to be aware of.</p>
        <h2>Ticket Type Option</h2>
        <p>Ticket Types are now triggered by the Ticket Type field in your offer. You must select the corresponding Ticket Type when creating AXS Premium, ADA, or VIP <MadCap:variable name="General.FanSight" /> offers.</p>
        <p>Until now, you have had to use very specific status codes in order todisplay the “ticket type” categories in a co-mingled offer. The latest enhancements now make it possible for you to select the Ticket Type in the offer configuration.. When you use the Accessible, <MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> Premium, or VIP Ticket Types in your offer, the correct category is now displayed in <MadCap:variable name="General.FanSight" />:</p>

            </img>
        </p>
        <p class="Figure">Select ticket types during office creation</p>
        <p>Every offer without one of these Ticket Types will be considered a “Standard” Ticket Type offer.</p>
        <h3>About Existing Offers</h3>
        <p>
			You may need to update existing <MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" />
			Premium | ADA | VIP offers depending on your offer configuration.
		</p>
        <ul class="checkBullet">
            <li>
			If the Label in your offer was blank or set to <span class="bold">Standard,</span> <MadCap:variable name="General.FanSight" /> will use the Status Code (the old method of identifying the Ticket Type). </li>
            <li>If your offers were set to <span class="italics">anything else</span>, you need to add the correct <span class="bold">Ticket Type</span> in the offer so they display properly.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul class="Important">
            <li>
                <MadCap:snippetText src="../../../../Resources/Snippets/ImportantSnippet.flsnp" />Please check your <MadCap:variable name="General.CompanyName" /> Premium and other co-mingled offers now and update them if needed. <span class="bold italics">Do not use the bulk offer edit tool to fix orders for multiple events at once.</span> Doing so will likely wipe out or overwrite your offer images and re-set your offer start and end dates. It is best to update and save each offer manually</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Offer Descriptions in Co-mingled Offers</h2>
        <p>Co-mingled ADA and VIP offers now show  the first 40 characters of the offer description for each related offer and a link to the related description when seats are carted.</p>

        <p>Clicking <span class="bold">More Info</span> opens up the complete description:</p>
